        Living a Healthy Lifestyle:
        <p>
            To lead a healthy life, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests consuming plenty of fruits and 
            vegetables, reducing the intake of fats, sugar, and salt, and engaging in regular physical activity. 
            Maintaining a healthy body weight can be determined by checking one's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on 
            and weight. WHO offers a range of guidelines to promote healthy living.
        </p>
        <p>
            **12 Guidelines for Healthy Eating**:
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a Nutrition-Rich Diet: Base your diet primarily on plant-based foods.</li>
                <li>Frequent Consumption of Carbohydrates: Incorporate bread, whole grains, pasta, rice, or potatoes into daily meals.</li>
                <li>Daily Vegetable and Fruit Intake: Prioritize fresh, local produce, aiming for at least 400g per day.</li>
                <li>Maintain a Healthy Weight: Keep your BMI between 18.5–25 through daily physical activity.</li>
                <li>Fat Intake Awareness: Limit fats to 30% of daily energy, focusing on unsaturated fats.</li>
                <li>Protein Choices: Opt for beans, legumes, lentils, fish, poultry, or lean meat over fatty meats.</li>
                <li>Dairy Products: Select low-fat, low-salt options.</li>
                <li>Limit Sugars: Minimize intake of free sugars, sugary drinks, and sweets.</li>
                <li>Salt Consumption: Keep salt intake below one teaspoon (5g) per day, including in processed foods.</li>
                <li>Moderate Alcohol: WHO advises that the healthiest choice is to abstain from alcohol, but if consumed, do so sparingly.</li>
                <li>Safe Food Preparation: Cook food through steaming, baking, boiling, or microwaving to limit added fat.</li>
                <li>Breastfeeding: Exclusively breastfeed up to 6 months, then introduce safe complementary foods, continuing breastfeeding until 2 years of age.</li>
            </ol>
            Note: BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI)**: 
            
            BMI, previously known as the Quetelet index, is a measure to indicate adult nutritional status. 
            It is derived by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (kg/m²). 
            For instance, an adult weighing 70 kg and height of 1.75 m will have a BMI of 22.9:

            <code>BMI = 70 kg / 1.75 m² = 22.9</code>

            **BMI Categories for Adults Over 20**:

            <p>Higher BMI values correlate with increased risk for diseases like cardiovascular issues, hypertension, 
            certain cancers, and diabetes.

            **BMI in Children and Adolescents**:
            
            BMI is also useful for children and teens, adjusted for age and sex, using specific cut-off points. 
            BMI-for-age is used to define overweight and obesity levels as per WHO standards:

            **Benefits of Regular Physical Activity**:
            
            Engaging in activities like walking, cycling, or dancing has multiple health benefits. It can lower the risk of chronic diseases, help manage weight, and enhance mental well-being. Physical activity fosters social interactions, boosts community bonds, and reduces risk behaviors.

            Additionally, promoting physical activity can decrease traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution, encouraging a healthier environment. It also supports workplace productivity and educational outcomes.
